<p>Here's a recipe on how to make a <em>delicious</em> Pancake. 
I created this webpage because I'm hungry and would like to eat <strong>Denny's Pancake</strong>.
So let's get started.</P>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

   <ul>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
   <ul>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</ul>
   <ul>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</ul>
   <ul>1 tablespoon white sugar</ul>
   <ul>1 tablespoon white sugar</ul>
   <ul>1 1/4 cups milk</ul>
   <ul>1 egg</ul>
   <ul>3 tablespoons butter, <strong>melted</strong></ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
    Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>

    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop
    the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on
    both sides and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
<h2> Editor's Note:</h2>

  <p>The salt amount has been reduced based on review feedback. The original recipe called
      for <strong>1 teaspoon.</strong>
