  <ul>Eggs</ul>
  <ul>Flour</ul>
  <ul>Dashi powder</ul>
  <ul>Soy Sauce</ul>
  <ul>Octopus/Tako</ul>
  <ul>Green onions</ul>

<h2>How to make Takoyaki</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.<br></li>
    <br>
    <li>Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the Octopus, slice the green onions and <br>
        make sure you have everything at the ready: A little dish of oil. all the ingredients, <br>
    some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve on. Heat up the pan. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. Give the batter a <br>
        whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the way up to the top. It’s okay <br>
        if they overflow a bit. Add in the fillings and let cook until the edges start to look <br>
        more solid and opaque.</li>
    <br>
    <li>se your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don’t easily move, they need <br>
        more time to crisp up. Once they’re at a 90° angle, pour in a bit more batter to ensure <br>
        a super round ball. Let cook, stuffing in any excess batter that’s outside the ball, <br>
        then turn again. You should have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, <br>
        moving the balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is because most pans will <br>
        have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to flip them.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and brush with takoyaki sauce <br>
        and squeeze on some mayo. Top. Finish with a sprinkle of bonito and aonori. Enjoy!</li>
